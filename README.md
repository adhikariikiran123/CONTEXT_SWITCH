# Context_Switching
Context switching is crucial as it is a core capability of multitasking systems like Windows, MacOS and Linux. In Context switching, multiple processes share a single CPU and execute simultaneously without conflicting with each other. The CPU handles concurrent execution of these executing processes by frequently switching between them, creating an illusion that multiprogramming is taking place.
This project demonstrates how Operating system handles different Process States, CPU Scheduling, I/O interrupts, memory management and resource management.

# To work on this project
If you want to run it on windows, then you will have to create a Linux Environment in your Windows OS by WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
